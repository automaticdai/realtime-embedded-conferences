# Real-Time/Embedded Systems Conferences (and related)

Track the most influenced conferences in _real-time_ / _embedded systems_, _design automation_ and _robotics_. This list is updated in a frequently basis. The list is _ordered by deadlines_ if the conference is not yet hold, otherwise it will be _ordered by the conference opening date_. The idea is to keep tracking of these conferences including up-to-date updates, so no CFPs and important announcements will be missed.

***Contribute:*** This list is for the community's benefit thus it is therefore a _shared responsibility_ to make sure the contents in this list are correct to the best knowledge. To update the list, you can either: (1) create a git pull request (PR), or (2) commit an issue in the [issue list](https://github.com/automaticdai/realtime-embedded-conferences/issues).

***Caution:*** Some of the deadlines are in local time, so please be aware of the timezone when the deadline is approaching. The deadline is for the paper, some of the conferences require the authors to submit an abstract before the final deadline, which will be noted in the `Remarks` section.
