# Real-Time/Embedded Systems, Design Automation and related Conferences Tracking

![](https://badgen.net/github/stars/automaticdai/realtime-embedded-conferences)  ![](https://badgen.net/github/issues/automaticdai/realtime-embedded-conferences)  ![](https://badgen.net/github/contributors/automaticdai/realtime-embedded-conferences)

Track the most influenced conferences in _real-time_ systems, _embedded systems_, _design automation_ and _robotics_. This list is updated in a frequently basis (normally weekly). The list is _ordered by deadlines_ before submission, otherwise it will be _ordered by conference opening date_. The idea is to keep tracking of these conferences including up-to-date information, so the researchers within the community will not miss important announcements and useful information.

***Contributing to this list:*** This list is for the community's benefit thus it is therefore a _shared responsibility_ to make sure the contents in this list are correct to the best knowledge. To update the list, you can either: (1) create a git pull request (PR), or (2) commit an issue in the [issue list](https://github.com/automaticdai/realtime-embedded-conferences/issues).

***Caution of time zones:*** Some of the deadlines are in local time zone, but most are A.O.E, i.e., anywhere on earth. Please be aware of the time zone especially when the deadline is approaching. The deadline is for the manuscript, and some of the conferences may have a deadline for abstract (normally one week earlier), which will be noted in the `Remarks` section if it is mandatory.

***Maintainer:***  This page and the GitHub repository are maintained by *[Dr. Xiaotian Dai](http://www.xiaotiandai.com)* from Real-Time Systems Research Group, University of York, UK.
