# Real-Time/Embedded Systems Conferences (and related)

## Introduction

Track the most influenced conferences in **real-time systems**, **embedded systems**, **design automation** and **robotics**. This list is updated in a frequently basis. The list is *ordered by deadlines* if the conference is not yet hold, otherwise it will be *ordered by the conference start date*. The idea is to keep tracking of these conferences including real-time updates so no CFPs and important announcements will be missed.

**Contribute:** This list is for the community's benefit thus it is therefore a shared responsibility to make sure the contents in this list are correct to the best knowledge. To update the list, you can either: (1) create a git pull request, or (2) commit an issue.

Some of the deadlines are in local time, so please be aware of the timezone when the deadline is approaching. The deadline is for the paper, some of the conferences require the authors to submit an abstract before the final deadline, which will be noted in the Remarks section.
